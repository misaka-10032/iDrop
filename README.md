It's my homework of pattern recognition course in college. And it's online "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/idrop/id784504288?mt=8"; demo comes "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZznA7_SrvUg"; try it if you want. It's done in a rush; maybe a bit simple and ugly, but still FUN.

When Playing
-----
Move your head left/right to control the character, where the camera would detect the center of your face related to the frame to decide whether to go left/right or stay still. Do not move too fiercely, because the recognizer could fail to recognize you.
